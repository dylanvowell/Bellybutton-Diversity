# OVERVIEW
Using test samples from the bellybuttons of various people, I built a dashboard to visualize the different types of bacteria living in each person's navel. There is a dropdown menu that allows users to pick test subjects by their ID number. Once chosen, A series of charts will show the bacteria present, how many times the subject washes their navel per week, and a final graph showing the cultures per sample.

## Process
Using JavaScript, Plotly.js, event listeners, and API calls, I extracted json data from a research team to create a dashboard that displayes the top 10 bacterial species in their navels. I created a bar chart, bubble chart, and gague chart to visualize the extracted data.
