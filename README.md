# OVERVIEW
Using test samples from the bellybuttons of various people, I built a dashboard to visualize the different types of bacteria living in each person's navel. There is a dropdown menu that allows users to pick test subjects by their ID number. Once chosen, A series of charts will show the bacteria present, how many times the subject washes their navel per week, and a final graph showing the cultures per sample.
